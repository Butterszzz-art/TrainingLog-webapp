# TrainingLog

This project contains a simple fitness tracker.
It now includes a **Community** tab for experimenting with group
workouts. Users can create groups in the browser and post simple
updates. A small leaderboard helper ranks members based on provided
consistency and improvement scores. These features are purely
client-side placeholders.

## Community API

When running the Express server, a small set of community endpoints is
available:

- `POST /community/groups` – create a new group by name. Include a
  `creatorId` field in the body and the creator is added to the group.
- `GET /community/groups?userId=USER` – list the groups that contain the
  specified user.
- `POST /community/groups/:groupId/share` – share a program with the
  group.
- `GET /community/groups/:groupId/progress` – return a summary of member
  progress and a simple leaderboard.
- `POST /community/groups/:groupId/posts` – add a comment to the group
  (use `GET` on the same path to fetch posts).

## Running Tests

Tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Install dependencies and run the test suite with:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Server Configuration

`server.js` exposes a `/config` endpoint that provides the Airtable credentials. Create a `.env` file with the following variables before starting the server:

```bash
AIRTABLE_TOKEN=yourTokenHere
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=yourBaseIdHere
```

Run the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Front-End Configuration

The web app can optionally read Airtable credentials from a local
`config.js` module. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and fill in your
values:
`config.js` contains private credentials. The file is ignored by Git so you
can keep your token out of version control.

The web app reads Airtable credentials from a small `config.js` file at
runtime. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp config.example.js config.js
# edit config.js and set AIRTABLE_TOKEN and AIRTABLE_BASE_ID
```

The file exports two constants:

```javascript
export const SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';
export const airtableConfig = {
  airtableToken: 'yourToken',
  airtableBaseId: 'yourBase'
};
```

Optionally, set `SERVER_URL` to point at the Express backend that exposes the
`/config` route. When no backend is reachable, the page falls back to the
values provided in `config.js`.
Optionally, set `SERVER_URL` if you are running the Express backend that
exposes the `/config` route. Leaving it blank will load the credentials directly
from `config.js`.
