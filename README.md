# TrainingLog

This project contains a simple fitness tracker.
It now includes a **Community** tab for experimenting with group
workouts. Users can create groups in the browser and post simple
updates. A small leaderboard helper ranks members based on provided
consistency and improvement scores. These features are purely
client-side placeholders.

Recent updates added an offline action queue and a theme selector with
two dark themes. Auto-generated workout suggestions now pre-populate set
inputs based on your last session and a simple progression analysis will
recommend deload weeks when plateaus are detected. Additional helper
modules expose periodization and meal planning utilities.

## Community API

When running the Express server, a small set of community endpoints is
available:

- `POST /community/groups` – create a new group. Include `name`,
  `creatorId` and optional `goal` and `tags` fields and the creator is added
  to the group.
- `GET /community/groups?userId=USER` – list the groups that contain the
  specified user. Additional query params `goal`, `tag` and `search` can be
  used to filter groups.
- `POST /community/groups/:groupId/share` – share a program with the
  group.
- `GET /community/groups/:groupId/progress` – return a summary of member
  progress and a simple leaderboard.
- `POST /community/groups/:groupId/posts` – add a comment to the group
  (use `GET` on the same path to fetch posts).

## Running Tests

Tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Install dependencies and run the test suite with:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Server Configuration

`server.js` exposes a `/config` endpoint that provides the Airtable credentials. Create a `.env` file with the following variables before starting the server:

```bash
AIRTABLE_TOKEN=yourTokenHere
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=yourBaseIdHere
```

Run the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Front-End Configuration

The web app can optionally read Airtable credentials from a local
`config.js` module. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and fill in your
values:
`config.js` contains private credentials. The file is ignored by Git so you
can keep your token out of version control.

The web app reads Airtable credentials from a small `config.js` file at
runtime. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp config.example.js config.js
# edit config.js and set AIRTABLE_TOKEN and AIRTABLE_BASE_ID
```

The file exports two constants:

```javascript
window.SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';
window.airtableConfig = {
  airtableToken: 'yourToken',
  airtableBaseId: 'yourBase'
};
```

Optionally, set `SERVER_URL` to point at the Express backend that exposes the
`/config` route. When no backend is reachable, the page falls back to the
values provided in `config.js`.
During development you can override `window.SERVER_URL` to use a local backend
like `http://localhost:3000`.


## Monorepo Structure

This repository uses **Yarn workspaces** to manage a small monorepo. The layout is:

- `web/` – existing web application and Express server
- `mobile/` – React Native app (placeholder in this environment)
- `packages/common/` – shared JavaScript utilities used by both apps

Workspaces are defined in the root `package.json`. The React Native bundler is configured to watch the `packages/common` directory so modules can be shared across platforms.
